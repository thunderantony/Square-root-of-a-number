# Find the square root of a number

## AIM:

To write a program to find the square root of a number.

## Equipments Required:

1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm

1. Define a function.
2. Assign number_iters = 100 in the function to perform 100 iteratios.
3. Set i = 0.
4. Calculate number = 0.5 \* (number + a / number) for 100 iterations.
5. Return number

## Program:
